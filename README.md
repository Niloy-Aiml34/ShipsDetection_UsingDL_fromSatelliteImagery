## üö¢ Detecting Ships using Satellite Images with Deep Learning üåç

This project utilizes deep learning algorithms to detect ships in satellite images. The ability to accurately detect ships is crucial for various applications, including maritime surveillance, traffic monitoring, and environmental monitoring.

## Project Overview

### Workflow of this Notebook

1. **Introducing Dataset**  
   Overview of the satellite image dataset used for ship detection, including the data source, format, and key characteristics.

2. **Object Detection, Image Classification, and Segmentation**  
   Explanation of the core tasks involved in this project: detecting ships (object detection), classifying regions in the image (image classification), and identifying exact boundaries (image segmentation).

3. **Importing Necessary Libraries and Modules**  
   A list and brief description of the Python libraries and modules used in this project, such as TensorFlow, NumPy, and OpenCV.

4. **Exploring the Dataset**  
   Detailed exploration of the dataset, including visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.

5. **Run Length Encoding and Decoding**  
   Explanation and implementation of run-length encoding (RLE) and decoding techniques used to represent the segmentation masks.

6. **Preparing Data for Our Model**  
   Steps involved in preprocessing the data, including resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the data into training and validation sets.

7. **Brief Introduction to UNET Model**  
   Overview of the UNET model architecture, which is well-suited for image segmentation tasks, and why it was chosen for this project.

8. **Build and Train UNET Model**  
   Building the UNET model using Keras/TensorFlow and training it on the prepared dataset. This section includes details on hyperparameters, loss functions, and training process.
